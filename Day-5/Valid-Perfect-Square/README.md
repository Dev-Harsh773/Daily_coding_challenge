## Problem: Valid Perfect Square

### Problem Statement (in my words):
Given a positive number, check if it is a perfect square (e.g., 4, 9, 16, etc.)

### Approach:
1. Use binary search to find if there exists a number whose square is equal to the given number.
2. If found, return true. Otherwise, return false.

### Time Complexity:
- O(log n)

### Space Complexity:
- O(1)
